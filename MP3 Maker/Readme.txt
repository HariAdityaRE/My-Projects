   This is an application developed using Python which extracts text from PDF/Txt/Image File and converts text into speech and saves as an MP3 File.

-> This application uses the Following:-

1. Tkinter Module - To Create the GUI for the application.
2. PyTesseract Module - To Extract text from image files.
3. IBM_watson Module - This Module is used to perform the text to speech conversion.

-> This application can create Audio files using the following File Types:-

1. PDF -> Extracts Text from .pdf file and converts it into audio File.
2. TXT -> Extracts Text from .txt file and converts it into audio File.
3. Image -> Extracts Text from image type files (.png,.jpg,etc) and converts it into audio file.

-> There are certain bugs in the application such as the it may not respond while creating the audio file but be patient it will complete the task.
-> Sometimes the conversion doesn't happen due to the limitation of IBM Watson Speech-to-Text API as it limitless no.of characters converted to 10,000 per month.
