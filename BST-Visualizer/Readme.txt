                      -----------------------------------------------------BST VISUALIZER--------------------------------------------------------------

-> This project is a visualizer for the Binary Search Tree(BST) created using the Turtle module in Python.
-> This is used to visualize how the binary tree is constructed and also it visualizes the search path.
-> bst.py file contains the code to create and manipulate a BST
-> This Project is working fine and has no issues for now.
-> If you find any bugs please don't hesitate to modify the code and let me know.

NOTE :- This visualizer works clean when the height of the tree is less than 3.
        Above and equal to 3 the drawings Start to overlap on other drawings.
        Sorry for that,I am trying to fix it and will mostly try to update it.

-->This program has three functions:

1.Start:- This pops up an input window which allows user to enter the data of the BST as comma separated values and
          draws the BST based on the given input.

2.Search:- This pops up an input window that reads the element to be searched in the BST.If found,draws the search path
           for the corresponding element in the BST else informs the user that there is no such element in the BST.

3.Reset:- This buttons clears the screen and lets the user start the process all over again for a new data.
